-----------------------------------------------------
* For the sake of simplicity, let us just assume that the country/continent names are unique

* All turns start with reinforcement. Each turn, each player receives a number of armies equal to: 
(max(3, # of countries the player own/3)+(continent value of all continents controlled by the player)).

very turn, the players are given a number of armies that depends on the number of territories they
own (# of territories owned divided by 3, rounded down. If the player owns all the territories of an entire continent,
the player is given a number of armies corresponding to the continent’s control bonus value. In any case, the
minimal number of reinforcement armies for any player is 3.


-----------------------------------------------------
refactoring:

1) all/controller factory references all other factories:

2) all writes to console done via Utl.consoleMessage - adds logging

3) Refactor class names:
MessageType, MsgType
OrderExecutionController, OrderExecController
SoftwareFactoryController, ControllerFactory
UserMessageModel, AppMsg
OrderDeploy, DeployOrder
SoftwareFactoryModel, ModelFactory
SoftwareFactoryView, ViewFactory
IUserMessageModel, IAppMsg
MapEditorConsoleView, MapEditorConsole
GameStartupConsoleView, GameStartupConsole
GamePlayConsoleView, GamePlayConsole
IOrderModel, IOrder

4) moved deploy method from player class to order class

5) State pattern

6) Observer pattern

7) command pattern

8) constructor dependencies to factories




-------------

note: I'm moving deploy, advance, bomb and blockade from the player class into their respective order classes

refactored deploy + fixed some code with advance, bomb and blockade
