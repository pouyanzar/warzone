* For the sake of simplicity, let us just assume that the country/continent names are unique

* All turns start with reinforcement. Each turn, each player receives a number of armies equal to: 
(max(3, # of countries the player own/3)+(continent value of all continents controlled by the player)).

very turn, the players are given a number of armies that depends on the number of territories they
own (# of territories owned divided by 3, rounded down. If the player owns all the territories of an entire continent,
the player is given a number of armies corresponding to the continent’s control bonus value. In any case, the
minimal number of reinforcement armies for any player is 3.

refactoring:

1) all/controller factory references all other factories:

2) all writes to console done via Utl.consoleMessage - adds logging

3) Refactor class names:
MessageType, MsgType
OrderExecutionController, OrderExecController
SoftwareFactoryController, ControllerFactory
UserMessageModel, AppMsg
OrderDeploy, DeployOrder
SoftwareFactoryModel, ModelFactory
SoftwareFactoryView, ViewFactory
IUserMessageModel, IAppMsg
MapEditorConsoleView, MapEditorConsole
GameStartupConsoleView, GameStartupConsole
GamePlayConsoleView, GamePlayConsole
IOrderModel, IOrder
